  <h1>Privacy Policy for The Crate Escape</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 16, 2025.</p>

  <p>Welcome to The Crate Escape! We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights as a player.</p>

  <h2>What We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you sign in using Google OAuth, we receive the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your email address</li>
    <li>Your Google profile picture</li>
    <li>Your Google display name</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is stored securely in a Google Firestore database. It is not used within the game interface and is never displayed during gameplay.</p>

  <h2>Why We Store It</h2>
  <p>We use this data solely to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Save your game progress</li>
    <li>Sync your progress across devices you use to play The Crate Escape</li>
    <li>Identify your account if you request data deletion or support</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use your personal data for marketing, profiling, or in-game personalization.</p>

  <h2>Authentication</h2>
  <p>The Crate Escape uses Google Sign-In for authentication. We do not collect or store passwords—your login credentials are managed securely by Google. This helps ensure a safe and seamless experience across devices.</p>

  <h2>What We Don’t Do</h2>
  <p>We do not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Share your data with third parties</li>
    <li>Display your personal info in the game</li>
    <li>Track your activity outside of The Crate Escape</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>You can request deletion of your account and associated data at any time. Just email us at <a href="mailto:admin@warpfactor.co.uk">admin@warpfactor.co.uk</a>, and we’ll verify your identity using your Google account details before proceeding.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Your data is stored in Google Firestore, a secure cloud-hosted NoSQL database. We follow best practices to protect your information, but no system is 100% foolproof—so we rely on Google’s robust infrastructure and encourage you to sign out when you’re done playing.</p>
